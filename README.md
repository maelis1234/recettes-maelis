Hello !

Here is my personal website to share my personal recipes.
It is accessible on <https://recettes-maelis.vercel.app/>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with Tailwind CSS, Firebase & Firestore as backend and database.

To deploy this project locally, all you need is an operational Google Firebase database, then you can clone this directory and launch the project with the npm run dev command.
